Less is a take on a social media platform in the scope of a school project at [SAE](https://www.sae.edu/che/de/).

### Important information
Moesif Origin & CORS Changer must be installed. I'm unclear why it doesn't work without it even if I have stated cross origin allowed (make sure it is on):

You need to register a personal user to gain access to the project.

Put the "less_webapp" folder in htdocs with only the api and static as parent folders (the react build after "npm run build").
